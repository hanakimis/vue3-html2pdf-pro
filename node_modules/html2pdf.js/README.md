# @ssamilg/html2pdf.js

## This is a fork of [htm2pdf.js](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js) with dependecy updates.

[html2canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas) package is unable to handle `oklch` color function. In this fork, [html2canvas-pro](https://github.com/yorickshan/html2canvas-pro) used instead.

For more information and configuration you can visit the [htm2pdf.js](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf.js)
